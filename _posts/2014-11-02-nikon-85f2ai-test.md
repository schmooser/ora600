title: Test of Nikon 85mm f/2 AI lens

Yesterday I bought very old lens â€“ Nikon 85mm f/2 AI. I read about it on [Ken
Rockwell's site][kenrockwell] and decided that it fits my needs as 85mm lens.

I chose between 85mm f/2 AI and 85 f/1.4 AI-s. On the f/2's side was bargain
price ($140), small weight (2 times lighter than f/1.4), size of filters (52mm,
I have many filters and caps on that size). But I still wanted to buy f/1.4
because everyone says that it's magnificent lens. As for f/2, reviews are varied
from moderate to positive. I had a good lot for f/1.4 (it was selling for about
$400) so I wanted to buy it, but at the last moment merchant said that I was
overthrown by someone who sent money by mail. So I decided to buy f/2.

##Sharpness

Here are images at different apperture settings:

![f/4](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7517/15071448284_8229bd5a6a_c.jpg)

As expected, at f/2 the lens if very soft but at f/2.8 and f/4 it becomes very sharp.

## Bokeh

What I want from 85mm lens is a good bokeh. I plan to use it for potraits so bokeh should be neutral or good. Unfortunately, this lens has a poor bokeh at any apertures. Look how crispy and distracting are the out-of-focus parts of the images. Disgusting!

Out of focus grass looks terrible.
