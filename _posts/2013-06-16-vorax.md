[Vorax] is a plugin for vim which turns it to full-featured Oracle IDE
on your fingertips. It merges SQL\*Plus functionality inside vim in native way.
Now version 4 is under active development.

But it's kind of geeky to use it and install. I used to use it on Windows
environment and it was kind of pain. But Windows has dozen of good Oracle
IDE's, like TOAD or PL/SQL Developer. Now I'm on OS X and the only option is
Oracle's SQL Developer which is free but has terrible UI and bad performance.
That's why I decided to try Vorax again.

After about a month of wars with environment, different ruby versions, and so
on, I finally made all work and will cover what I did here.

First of all, I tried to use [homebrew] as OS X package manager.
It's very simple and useful. Go use it.

I also switched from bash to zsh. At the first time I used [oh-my-zsh]
as the set of extensions. Then I switched to [yadr] which brings a lot of
other staff, such as dozens of vim plugins, config files for git, hg, svn, tons
of shortcuts and so on. After using it about for about a three weeks I decided
that I want control of myself on whole this mess and deleted almost all
dot-started files and dirs from my HOME. And started a new life. I installed
oh-my-zsh again and tweaked it. I also put all my dotfiles into a separate
directory and put it on [GitHub][rbddotfiles].

All this on Vorax is also worked on Windows. See
[here][install-vorax-on-windows] for the installation
process of Vorax on Windows.

## Vorax

There is an issue with Vorax and MacVim installed via homebrew. Such MacVim is
compiled with system Ruby, which is 1.8 and is not supported by Vorax. I have
RVM with Ruby 1.9.3 which is ok, but homebrew's MacVim doesn't see it. That's a
known issue and the way to go around it is to compile MacVim manually. I did it
as described in [manual][macvim-building] and now it works with Vorax.

I also made shell script [`vorax.sh`][vorax.sh] (and aliased it with `vorax`)
to start MacVim with Vorax plugin loaded because I don't always need Oracle and
Vorax and there are some problems in OS X with `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`. See
[this post][oracle-dyld] for details.

Here I will explain tips and tricks to work with Vorax. I use
[Vorax4-beta] and it doesn't have all features for now, so I use
only those, which present.

### Basic usage

In sql-buffer (file with sql extension) Vorax determines command and send them
to SQL\*Plus. `,e` executes something under cursor. It can be SELECT statement,
DML or DDL statement, PL/SQL block or SQL\*Plus command.

### Using omnicompletion

To use omnicompletion use `<C-x><C-o>`. If it will find something to find, it'll
show you a dialog to complete. Look at screenshot:

### Explain Plan

To explain execution plan I do the following:

1. Append `explain plan for` before SQL statement and execute it. The result is `Explained`.
2. Do `select * from table(dbms_xplan.display);`. The output is the desired plan.

### Vorax configuration

I use this Vorax-specified settings in my `.vimrc`:

* `let g:vorax_output_window_default_funnel = 2 " This sets up Vorax to use PAGEZIP default output window style`
* `set omnifunc=syntaxcomplete#Complete " Enables autocompletion`
