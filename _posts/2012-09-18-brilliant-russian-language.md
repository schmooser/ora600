##The complex Russian language

There is a table behind us. There are glass and a fork on it. What are they doing? The glass is standing, but the fork is laying. If we stick the fork in the tabletop then the fork will be standing. So, vertical stuff stands and horizontal lie. 

Now let's add a plate and a pan on the table. They are seemed to be a horizontal, but they are standing on the table. Now we put the plate into the pan. Voila, the plate is laying in the pan nevertheless it was standing on the table.

May be the stuff that is ready to using is standing? No, the fork was ready to use whet it was laying on the table. 

Now a cat is climbing on the table. It can sit on the table as well as lay and stand on it. We can explain "lay" and "stand" with "vertical-horizontal" logic, but sitting is the new one property. It's sitting on the butt. Now a bird sits on a table. It sits on a table, but it sits on its legs not on butt. But it should be staying! If we remove the bird and make a staffed bird from it, it  will magically stands on the table!

It seems that sitting is the being's property, but a boot is sitting on the leg as it's not a being and it have no butt. So, let's understand what is sitting, what is laying and what is standing.

And we russians are wondering why foreigners think that Russian is complicated and compare it to Chinese.
